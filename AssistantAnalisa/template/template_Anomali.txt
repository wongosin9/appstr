Objective:

Develop a generative AI model to effectively identify anomalous transactions based on specified features and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

Data Requirements:

A comprehensive dataset of transaction records, including details such as:
Transaction ID /noarsip
Account ID / norekening
Transaction amount/nominaltx
Transaction date and time/txtimestamp
Chanel ID,
terminal,
geoloc,
Transaction type (e.g., purchase, withdrawal, transfer,payment)

Additional relevant features based on the specific anomaly detection criteria
Model Requirements:

Utilize a generative AI model, such as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to learn the distribution of normal transactions considering the specified features.
Train the model on the provided financial transaction data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
Anomaly Detection:

For each new transaction, pass it through the trained generative AI model.
Calculate the probability of the transaction under the learned distribution.
Transactions with extremely low probabilities are considered anomalous and should be flagged for further investigation.
Visualization using Matplotlib:

Create visualizations to represent the distribution of transactions and highlight anomalous patterns.
Consider using:
Scatter plots to visualize transactions based on relevant features.
Histograms to show the distribution of transaction amounts, dates, or other numerical features.
Box plots to compare the distribution of features across different groups (e.g., normal vs. anomalous transactions).
Employ color-coding to differentiate between normal and anomalous transactions.
Additional Considerations:

Implement techniques to handle imbalanced data, as fraudulent transactions may be a minority in the dataset.
Consider incorporating additional features, such as customer behavior patterns or geographical information, to improve anomaly detection.
Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with updated data to maintain effectiveness in detecting evolving fraud patterns.
Evaluation and Refinement:

Evaluate the model's ability to identify true anomalous transactions while minimizing false positives.
Analyze the types of transactions flagged as anomalous to identify areas for improvement.
Refine the model architecture, hyperparameters, and feature selection based on evaluation results.
Expected Outcome:

A robust generative AI model capable of effectively identifying anomalous transactions based on specified features, along with informative visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate the results.

Additional Notes:

The specific generative AI model and training techniques may vary depending on the characteristics of the data and the desired performance requirements.
It is crucial to ensure the model is well-calibrated to accurately assess the probability of each transaction.
Regularly monitoring and updating the model is essential to adapt to evolving fraud tactics and maintain effectiveness.
The choice of visualizations should be tailored to the specific features and anomaly detection criteria to effectively convey the insights.
Consider using interactive data visualization tools like Plotly or Bokeh for more dynamic and user-friendly visualizations.
